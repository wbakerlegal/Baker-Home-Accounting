                <p>This website (q͜ʘ, Baker Home Accounting; the &#x201C;Software&#x201D;) runs in your device&#x2019;s web browser and stores data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet associated with your Google account. The Software accesses data only from (a) the Google Sheets spreadsheet created by the Software at your direction or (b) a Google Sheets spreadsheet linked using a URL you supply. While you use the Software, your data is sent between your device and the connected Google Sheets spreadsheet. Your data is processed in your device&#x2019;s web browser for the sole purpose of displaying information to you. None of the data in your Google Sheets spreadsheets is visible to the server hosting the Software or any owner or developer of the Software.</p>
                <p>The Software stores some of your data in your device&#x2019;s web browser, using the Web Storage API. The title and spreadsheet ID of the connected spreadsheet are saved so you can reconnect more easily. This data can be removed from your device&#x2019;s web browser by selecting the option to &#x201C;remove&#x201D; the selected spreadsheet in the General Setup area of the Software. If the option to &#x201C;keep me signed in&#x201D; is checked, the contents of the connected Google Sheets spreadsheet are stored in your device&#x2019;s web browser to enable limited offline functionality. All data from the connected spreadsheet is removed from your device&#x2019;s web browser by selecting the option to &#x201C;disconnect&#x201D; in the General Setup area of the Software.</p>
                <p>The Software&#x2019;s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
